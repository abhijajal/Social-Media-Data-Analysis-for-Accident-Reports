# Social-Media-Data-Analysis-for-Accident-Reports
Each .txt is named in following format: tweetDataset_YOURNAME.txt
In order to avoid confusion, please make sure you only download and start labelling the .txt file which has your name on it.

## File structure
Each line in the file, represents a single tweet.
Each line looks like :   tweet::::::
After labelling each line should look like 
1) tweet::::::1 OR 2) tweet::::::0 
Based on the each tweet's contents.
#### 1 is the class label for Accidental Tweets
#### 0 is the class label for Non-Accidental Tweets 

## Rules for Labelling: Accidental (1) vs Non-Accidental Tweets (0)

If your are still confused about the class of the tweet...
Copy paste the tweet in "group me" group, and we all will discuss about it.

## After you are done with Labelling
Make sure you have been added as a Collaborator to the github repo,
Then, go to the dataset branch from where you got your txt file.
And then click on "Upload files" and upload your labelled tweet txt file, make sure you don't change the name of the txt file, so that it will automatically update the old unlablled txt file to the new labelled txt file. 


#### I am hoping that we would be able to get done with the labelling thing by Sunday the 10th
