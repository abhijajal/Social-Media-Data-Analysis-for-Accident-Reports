# Social-Media-Data-Analysis-for-Accident-Reports
Each .txt is named in following format: tweetDataset_YOURNAME.txt
In order to avoid confusion, please make sure you only download and start labelling the .txt file which has your name on it.

## File structure
Each line in the file, represents a single tweet.
Each line looks like :   tweet::::::
After labelling each line should look like 
1) tweet::::::1 OR 2) tweet::::::0 
Based on the each tweet's contents.
#### 1 is the class label for Accidental Tweets
#### 0 is the class label for Non-Accidental Tweets 

## Rules for Labeling: Accidental (1) vs Non-Accidental Tweets (0)


#### I am hoping that we would be able to get done with the labeling thing by Sunday the 10th
