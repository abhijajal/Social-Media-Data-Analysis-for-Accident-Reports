@Ha3lium They blocked out of the account the only autist that actually made any money and his position went from +60k to -200k, with him unable to sell, so I guess lawyers take all, as usual? Not to worry, I have found better, this guy made $11M by accident: https://t.co/WYcodkV7Wz::::::0
@ShayneRarma @vanOnselenP Where did he say he was a police officer? He said he worked with the cops, which is a pretty accurate statement.  Given the p-plater left the scene of an accident without stopping, refused to provide details as required by law, good on Elliott for trying to pull him into line::::::0

@emrata So what?  Look, the man was bad.  B...A...D. And apparently killed himself.  I don't know (nor care) if someone helped him or he just had an "accident".  The authorities are looking at it.  Folks are jumping to conclusions and/or looking for some other conspiracy behind it all.::::::0
