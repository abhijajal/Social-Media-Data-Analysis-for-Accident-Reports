@AlkaliFisherman @guardian No. What is known is that she admitted to police that she had hit someone while driving on the wrong side of the road. Harry Dunn was on his own for 43 minutes. Had assistance been called when the accident happened, he may well have survived. That is an aggravating circumstance.
