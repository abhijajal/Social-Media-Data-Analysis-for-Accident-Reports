@AllenThomas4ENC @AdaKirschner @allontheline_nc @allontheline @lekhashupeck @WomanResistorNC @ncrainbowgrrl @dEMMAcratic @keith_pochick @GrootResists This can't be an accident. Universities &amp; surrounding areas often lean Dem. I don't have specific #'s, but I'm guessing that's true for the ECU area. NC-01 is already strong Dem (Rep. Butterfield), and sequestering ECU &amp; the med center into NC01 means NC03 = safer red district. https://t.co/lq7wYi4JqD::::::0

It's imperative that you get insurance while it's still available. I was uninsured when I had an auto accident  in '09. $500k+ in medical bills and being discharged with 2 broken legs, a broken neck and no way to take care of myself at home was a wake-up call!
