@OneBlacklisted @joe_manniello They have consistency at the OC position or have a new innovative offense. If the Giants get a young OC, he won’t be there long especially if he’s successful.

@jkonowe @pjsandiegosdca @RadioFreeTom @reneecosta @KevinMKruse Independents aren't into it either. Every poll shows them, but fairly large margins not in favor of impeachment.

1) A lot of projects approach us for PR and never hire us - or anyone. It tells me there’s some disarray out there. I think sometimes PR is an act of desperation. They think it’s the silver billet to their customer problems.::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:07 +0000 2019
2) The majority of companies that do crypto PR aren’t that good. In Q4 we have picked up some major projects who left their PR firm. Most firms out there struggle to get bigger coverage for projects. Ditto tends to only generate top tier media.::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:07 +0000 2019
3) While PR firms struggle to do the basics, Ditto has grown its capabilities so much we are just way ahead of our “competitors.”::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:07 +0000 2019
4) Media relations is only a part of what we do. The majority of our clients hire us to do: branding and positioning, draft and place bylines, event creation and management, social media strategy, crisis and community education and activation.::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:08 +0000 2019
5) Here’s the signal: projects that are doing all the possible comms and marketing capabilities will be VERY external in 2020. You will see them everywhere. And you will say “Man, you guys are everywhere!”::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:08 +0000 2019
6) It shows me that projects are acting like real companies! And they are approaching communications like a real consumer tech or financial services company!::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:09 +0000 2019
7) Then there are other projects who are scraping by with small comms budgets and hire a PR firm bc they are cheap. It’s not a winning approach and a such low adoption in crypto they will struggle in 2020.::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:09 +0000 2019
8) And yes, the tech should sell itself. And amazing projects like Casa and Lolli don’t need PR right now. But crypto is a small crowded place and just like in the traditional consumer tech or fintech space, companies have to differentiate or fade away.::::::Tue Nov 26 13:10:09 +0000 2019

Was told once you start therapy or anything to combat your anxiety, that it's almost like hitting the gym  You won't see results quickly, but when you wake up and hit the gym that you'll start to see your gains  I truly believe folks make mental gains as well::::::Tue Nov 26 19:01:12 +0000 2019
So at first the anxiety that you feel it takes a while to figure out how to combat it. But when you're in therapy you start to take those mental reps on how to fight it.   What once took you days to get out of bed from, now only takes you a few mins::::::Tue Nov 26 19:01:12 +0000 2019
